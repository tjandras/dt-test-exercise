# Digital Thinkers test exercise

## `api.http` file

It is a special file, which can be used in Visual Studio code, if the Rest Client extension is installed (created by Huachao Mao). It is basically a text file, in which HTTP requests can be declared and run. Similar to Postman, but right inside VS Code. I used this file to test my app.

Github page for the extension: [Rest client](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient)

## `.vscode` folder

Usually this folder is not checked into source control. I thought it might come handy, therefore it is here.
